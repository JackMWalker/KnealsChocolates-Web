						<b>1. 100% Happiness is our guarantee</b><br><br>
						<li>At Kneals Chocolates we want you to be happy…..as simple as that. Our aim is to provide you with your chosen product in a perfect condition. Because Kneals is an independent artisan business, (the product is handmade in small batches), we aim for our usual maximum delivery time from the day of your request to delivery to be 5 days. However, at busier periods like Christmas and Easter where there is a high demand for our products, we cannot guarantee a time scale for delivery as the processing of your order may take slightly longer. Please make note of indications on the website of deadlines for final deliveries particularly at Christmas time. We apologise for any inconvenience should your delivery be delayed, and would recommend that you place your order early at busy times of year to avoid any disappointment.</li>
