				Organising a wedding can be stressful when you cannot find exactly what you want. 
				At Kneals we aim to provide bespoke wedding favours to add something special to your big day.
				We do not sell wedding favours directly online as we feel that it is essential for us to discuss various options with you. 
				So, if you have an idea, please contact us using the form below and we will try to make it reality.
