					<p>A Kneals Chocolate Party is all about letting you have a chocolate party hosted in the comfort of your own home on a evening that suits you. For you and your friends and family to enjoy together. </p>
					<br/><br/>
					<h3 class="sub-title">How does it work?</h3>
					<p>We arrive at your home to set up and then from 7:30pm friends and family can sample, buy or order from our wide range of handmade luxury chocolates.  </p>
					<br/><br/>
					<h3 class="sub-title">What do you receive?</h3>
					<p>In return you will receive 10% of our sales and orders totals for the evening in Kneals chocolate. So, for example, if our sales for the evening total to £300 you will obtain £30 to spend on any part of the Kneals chocolate range - it's a win-win situation! </p>
